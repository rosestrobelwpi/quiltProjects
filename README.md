# QuiltDesigner - a Programming Language for Quilts

## Description
Quilt Designer is a cozy website intended to allow code-oriented people to express their creative sides by designing quilt patterns. It has its own domain-specific programming language with custom syntax and built-in functionality to make designing quilts fun and easy. The user interface has a soft color palette and inviting appearance. Overall, the website promotes creativity through coding, establishes a user-friendly programming language, and encourages programmers to receive fulfillment through unique designs. 

This website was made by utilizing technologies such as React, CodeMirror, Peggy.js, and Jest. The first two tools were used for website design and user interfaces, and the latter were used for generating parse files and testing.
